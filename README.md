# Veer’s Personal Site

A minimal, typography‑first personal website inspired by the clean style of classic personal homepages.

## Getting started

- Open `index.html` directly in your browser, or serve the folder with a static server.
- Edit the content in `index.html` under the About, Projects, and Writing sections.
- Tweak typography and colors in `styles.css`.

## Customization

- Replace the email and social links in the Contact section.
- Add real URLs for your projects and posts.
- If you prefer sans‑serif, change the `font-family` in `styles.css` to `ui-sans-serif, system-ui, -apple-system, Segoe UI, Roboto, Helvetica, Arial`.

## Deploy

You can host this anywhere that serves static files:

- GitHub Pages
- Netlify
- Vercel
- Cloudflare Pages

No build step is required.
