        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>I co-founded <a href="https://fleetline.ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fleetline</a>.</p>
        <p>I'm working on combining LLMs with traditional advanced optimization techniques to solve planning problems in freight.</p>
        <p>I spend most of my time working on Fleetline or reading. I enjoy reading books on developmental economics (ie, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16144575-how-asia-works" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How Asia Works</a>), post-structuralist philosophy (ie, Barthes), lots of history, and some fiction (controversially, I quite enjoy Murakami). Though the time I have to read is slightly diminished, I would still appreciate any book recs, feel free to send them to my email below :) Tangentially, I also really enjoy tetris and chess.</p>
        <p>I am on leave from my combined BA/MA in <a href="https://dornsife.usc.edu/phil" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Philosophy</a> at USC, where I focused on philosophical logic and <a href="papers/arbitrariness-and-mathematical-ontology.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">philosophy of math</a>. While at USC, I was president of the Trojan Debate Society and competed internationally on a full scholarship. During my freshman year, I founded an education consulting company, which I scaled to ~$100k ARR and exited.</p>
        <p>Before college, I attended <a href="https://www.bcp.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bellarmine College Preparatory</a> in San Jose, California. There, I was president of the speech and debate team, which was the top-ranked team in the nation. Individually, I was the top debater in the country in Congressional Debate (Senate) at the 2021 NSDA Nationals, and I placed second at the 2022 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tournament_of_Champions_(debate)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TOC</a>.</p>
